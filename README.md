# SkyblockMod
Hypixel Skyblock Personal Fliipping Mod.

This is my personal version of my new flipping mod, currently in Beta.
This version is free and doesn't have a whitelist yet, although newer versions will have a whitelist included, with a price tag.
If you have any name suggestions, please contact me via discord, as I currently don't have any names in mind.

Setup:
1. Install forge 1.8.9 (the mod only works with forge). If you are unsure how to, you can search up tutorials on youtube. Also works with feather client.
2. Put both the files in your mods folder. Both files are needed (for now), as i couldn't get the config file to work with the main file yet.
3. Launch your game, and you should have flips pop up in your chat ever now and then!

Current in-game commands are:
/fm - opens the flipping mod gui
/fm help - lists the help commands

ALL SETTINGS CAN BE CHANGED IN THE GUI!
