Setup:
1. Install forge 1.8.9 (the mod only works with forge). If you are unsure how to, you can search up tutorials on youtube. Also works with feather client.
2. Put the JAR file in your mods folder. 
3. Launch your game, and you should have a step-by-step guide on how to verify your api key with the mod
